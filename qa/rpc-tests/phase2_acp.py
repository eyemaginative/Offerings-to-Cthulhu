"""
Phase-2 ACP regtest harness (issue #40).

Spins up two regtest daemons. Node 0 holds the test-fixture ACP privkey
via -checkpointkey=<WIF>. Mines blocks, then calls `sendcheckpoint` to
sign and broadcast a checkpoint. Node 1 receives + accepts. Verifies:

  PHASE 1 — peer the nodes, mine past coinbase maturity, confirm both
    nodes agree on the tip.

  PHASE 2 — broadcaster calls `sendcheckpoint <target_hash>`. Signature
    is generated using the test-fixture privkey; pubkey baked at
    src/chainparams.cpp (regtest vConclaveKeys, slot #0).

  PHASE 3 — peer (node 1) receives the checkpoint message, validates
    the signature against Params().ConclaveKeys()[0], and persists
    hashSyncCheckpoint. Confirmed by grepping the peer's debug.log for
    the ProcessSyncCheckpoint: sync-checkpoint at <hash> log line.

Test fixture privkey is derived deterministically from
sha256("OFFv2-test-checkpointkey-2026!!!"). It is NOT a real Conclave
key — it is embedded in this file and in chainparams.cpp solely for
regtest. Do not reuse it for testnet or mainnet.
